## Implementation Approach

### For Each Iteration:

1. **Run Current Notebook**
   - Execute all cells
   - Capture outputs
   - Note any errors or warnings

2. **Validate Results**
   - Check data quality metrics
   - Verify calculations
   - Confirm sample sizes

3. **Evaluate Insights**
   - What patterns emerged?
   - What questions arise?
